# BotRace
Create a bot and race with others through a maze

## Description
This project is a host for maze races. It expect some interfaces to be implemented by the racers and it will host a 
race between them to prove which one has a better implementation of a maze solving algorithm in each case.

## Status
At this point the only part of the project that is implemented is a Maze generation using the recursive backtracking algorithm.

## Intent
Is our intent to provide diferent implementations for each part of the application in C# and F# so we can learn and study the 
difference betwen them and the paradigms, and so can you.
